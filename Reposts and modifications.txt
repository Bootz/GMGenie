Dear user,

Since GM Genie is under an open source license, any modifications and redistributions of the addon are explicitely allowed, as long as copyright and license notes remain intact.

However, I would appreciate it if you could drop me a message if you post/publish GM Genie somewhere. Partly because I like to know where it is being spread, but also so I can add new versions to those threads when they are released. It would be a shame if everyone keeps using some ancient version because it was once posted on a forum, and never updated there.
You can drop me an e-mail at gmgenie@chocochaos.com

It's not a requirement to inform me, but I would greatly appreciate it =)

Regards,

Chocochaos
